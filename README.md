# Business-Questions-With-SQL

This repository is meant to be a showcase of my ability to use SQL to answer real-world type business questions.

I will be using [Micrsoft's Sample Northwind Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases).

The question's I will be answering have been pulled from several different sources including:
- [Source 1](https://www.amazon.com/SQLPractice-Problems-learn-doing/dp/1540422658)
- [Source 2](https://musiliadebayo.medium.com/50-sql-practice-queries-and-answers-3fc896650b2e)
- I will also be using [StrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding?code_type=3) which has various interview questions. 

### Question 1
For their annual review of the company pricing strategy, the Product Team wants to look at the products that are currently being offered for a specific price range ($20 to $50). In order to help them they asked you to provide them with a list of products with the following information:

1. their name
2. their unit price

Filtered on the following conditions:
1. their unit price is between 20 and 50
2. they are not discontinued

Finally order the results by unit price in a descending order (highest first).
